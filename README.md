## Credit

With respect to the Coursera policies, all codes and images present here are taken from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), and the aim of this repository is only to store assignments I completed as part of the courses.


## Topics and Technologies
All the codes are in Jupyter notebook. Some of the skills I gained in this specialization are as follows: 
- Neural Network Architecture, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network
- Mathematical Optimization, Hyperparameter tuning, Inductive Transfer
- Transformers, Seq Models, and ...
